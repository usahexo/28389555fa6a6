        <h1 id="Michigan-casinos-consider-5-million-in-betting-losses-a-‘successful-month’"><a href="#Michigan-casinos-consider-5-million-in-betting-losses-a-‘successful-month’" class="headerlink" title="Michigan casinos consider $5 million in betting losses a ‘successful month’"></a>Michigan casinos consider $5 million in betting losses a ‘successful month’</h1><p>Michigan’s three casinos say they had a “successful month” in November, despite taking in nearly $5 million less in bets than the same month last year.</p>
<p>The Detroit News reports that the casinos took in about $137 million in bets last month, compared to about $142 million in November 2017.</p>
<p>But the casinos say they still profited from increased business at their restaurants and hotels. MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown Casino-Hotel and MotorCity Casino Hotel all reported increased profits from gambling, food and hotel revenue.</p>
<p>MGM Grand Detroit president and CEO James Murren says the casino had its best month ever for non-gambling revenue.</p>
<p>Casino officials say the dip in betting is likely due to new competition in Ohio, where voters approved casinos in November.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-casinos-continue-to-see-revenue-decline-but-statewide-betting-losses-top-200-million"><a href="#Detroit-casinos-continue-to-see-revenue-decline-but-statewide-betting-losses-top-200-million" class="headerlink" title="Detroit casinos continue to see revenue decline, but statewide betting losses top $200 million"></a>Detroit casinos continue to see revenue decline, but statewide betting losses top $200 million</h1><p>Michigan’s casinos have seen their revenue decline for the eleventh consecutive month, according to the latest report from state regulators.</p>
<p>The three Detroit-area casinos brought in a combined total of $144.5 million in gross gaming revenue for July, down 3.7 percent from the same month last year. Statewide, casino gambling losses totaled $202.8 million, up slightly from the same period in 2017.</p>
<p>“While it is always disappointing to see a decrease in revenue, we continue to work hard to provide our guests with an enjoyable experience that will keep them coming back,” said Michael area of MGM Grand Detroit Casino in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>The report showed healthy growth at some of Michigan’s smaller casinos and racinos, while the three Detroit casinos continue to feel the pinch of increased competition from new riverboat casinos in Ohio.</p>
<p>Revenue at Greektown Casino was down 10.8 percent from a year ago, while MotorCity Casino saw a 6.9 percent decline and MGM Grand had a 2.5 percent drop. The state’s other casino, Jackpot Party Casino in Bay City, saw a whopping 45 percent increase in revenue compared to July 2017.</p>
<p>Slot machines accounted for nearly two-thirds of all gaming revenue statewide last month, with table games making up the rest. Gaming losses on slot machines were down slightly from last year, while table game losses increased by 5 percent statewide</p>
<h1 id="Michigan’s-racinos-see-big-increase-in-betting-losses"><a href="#Michigan’s-racinos-see-big-increase-in-betting-losses" class="headerlink" title="Michigan’s racinos see big increase in betting losses"></a>Michigan’s racinos see big increase in betting losses</h1><p>Racinos in Michigan continue to see substantial losses, with bets totaling $376 million in the 2017 fiscal year, a 13.5 percent increase from the previous year.</p>
<p>The state’s 12 casinos, which include racinos, took in $329 million in bets in 2016. In 2017, that number jumped to $370 million. Detroit’s three casinos accounted for about two-thirds of the statewide increase.</p>
<p>Despite the increase in betting losses, revenue from casino taxes increased by about 1 percent last year. That’s because lawmakers increased the tax rate on casino revenue from 17 to 25 percent in 2015. State officials say the higher tax rate is needed to make up for a decline in revenue from the lottery and other forms of gambling.</p>
<p>Wisconsin is one of six states without casinos or racinos.</p>
<h1 id="State’s-three-commercial-casinos-post-combined-7M-in-betting-losses-in-January"><a href="#State’s-three-commercial-casinos-post-combined-7M-in-betting-losses-in-January" class="headerlink" title="State’s three commercial casinos post combined $7M in betting losses in January"></a>State’s three commercial casinos post combined $7M in betting losses in January</h1><p>The state’s three commercial casinos posted combined net betting losses of $7 million in January, according to figures released Wednesday by the state Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>The Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville led the way with a $4.5 million net loss last month, while Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket had a $2.5 million net loss and the casino at Resorts World in Bridgeport had a $500,000 net loss.</p>
<p>Combined, the three casinos took in $191.4 million in bets last month and paid out $198.4 million, resulting in the $7 million net loss.</p>
<p>In January 2017, the casinos posted a combined net profit of nearly $1 million, with Mohegan Sun leading the way with a $2.5 million profit. Foxwoods was down almost $1 million from a year ago while Resorts World remained essentially flat.</p>
<p>The state’s slot parlors and racetracks reported combined net profits of nearly $9 million last month, down from nearly $11 million a year ago. Slot parlor revenues were down 3 percent statewide but profits held steady at the race tracks due to more aggressive marketing and promotional campaigns, including free bets for new customers.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan’s-total-gambling-losses-top-1B-for-first-time"><a href="#Michigan’s-total-gambling-losses-top-1B-for-first-time" class="headerlink" title="Michigan’s total gambling losses top $1B for first time"></a>Michigan’s total gambling losses top $1B for first time</h1><p>According to the latest report from the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the state’s total gambling losses topped $1 billion for the first time in 2018. This is a 6.5% increase over the previous year, and it’s clear that gaming continues to be a popular pastime in Michigan.</p>
<p>The report shows that casino gambling was responsible for the majority of losses, accounting for more than $900 million. This was followed by racing (nearly $48 million), bingo (more than $11 million), and lottery (nearly $10 million).</p>
<p>One of the interesting things to note is that slot machines were once again responsible for most of the losses, accounting for more than $750 million. This is despite the fact that there has been a decline in overall casino revenue in recent years. It seems that people are still attracted to playing slots, even though they may not be as profitable for casinos as they once were.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things play out in 2019 given the current economic environment. With concerns about a potential recession, it’s possible that we could see gambling losses start to level off or even decline slightly. However, it’s also possible that people will continue to gamble at a high rate, especially if unemployment remains low and consumer confidence stays strong.</p>
