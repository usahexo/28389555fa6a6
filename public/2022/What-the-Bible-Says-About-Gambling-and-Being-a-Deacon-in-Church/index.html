      What the Bible Says About Gambling and Being a Deacon in Church

        <h1 id="What-the-Bible-Says-About-Gambling-and-Being-a-Deacon-in-Church"><a href="#What-the-Bible-Says-About-Gambling-and-Being-a-Deacon-in-Church" class="headerlink" title="What the Bible Says About Gambling and Being a Deacon in Church"></a>What the Bible Says About Gambling and Being a Deacon in Church</h1><p>The Bible is clear about gambling and its dangers. In 1 Timothy 6:10, the Apostle Paul says, “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.”</p>
<p>Gambling can be very addictive and destructive. It can lead to greed, envy, bitterness, anger, lawsuits, and even stealing. It destroys families and relationships. It’s a sin that God hates.</p>
<p>In addition to being clear about the dangers of gambling, the Bible is also clear about the qualifications for being a deacon in church. A deacon must be “a man of dignity, not given to drunkenness or brawl” (1 Timothy 3:3). He must also be a man who is “faithful in all things” (1 Corinthians 4:2).</p>
<p>Clearly, gambling does not meet the qualifications for being a deacon in church. Gambling is an ungodly activity that leads to sin and destruction.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-and-Serving-as-a-Deacon-What-Does-the-Bible-Say"><a href="#Gambling-and-Serving-as-a-Deacon-What-Does-the-Bible-Say" class="headerlink" title="Gambling and Serving as a Deacon: What Does the Bible Say?"></a>Gambling and Serving as a Deacon: What Does the Bible Say?</h1><p>Gambling has been around since the early days of man. It’s been a part of almost every society in one form or another. But what does the Bible say about gambling? Is it ever acceptable?</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Bible doesn’t specifically mention gambling. However, there are teachings that can guide us in our understanding of the matter. Let’s take a look at a few key verses:</p>
<p>Proverbs 13:11 says, “Dishonest money dwindles away, but whoever gathers money little by little makes it grow.” This verse teaches that gambling, or any other form of earning wealth through shady means, will ultimately lead to ruin. Not only does it rob us of our money, but it also damages our character.</p>
<p>Another key verse is 1 Timothy 6:10 which says, “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” This verse makes it clear that greed for riches leads to sin and all sorts of problems. Gambling often appeals to those who are greedy – they hope to win big and get rich quickly. But as we see from this verse, that’s not often how things play out. Instead, those who gamble often lose their money and end up even more desperate for wealth.</p>
<p>So based on these verses, it seems that gambling is not something that God approves of. It can lead to sinful behaviour, hurt others financially, and deprive us of what we truly need. If we want to be obedient to God’s Word, then we should avoid gambling altogether.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean that we can’t enjoy other forms of recreation like betting on sports or playing casino games. These activities are not inherently sinful – as long as we don’t let them become an obsession or cause us to disobey God’s laws. In fact, Proverbs 14:27 says, “The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, turning a person away from the snares of death.” When we remember that God sees everything we do and that He desires for us to have a joyful life (Psalm 136:1), then we can enjoy these activities without any guilt or worry.</p>
<h1 id="Can-You-Serve-as-a-Deacon-if-You-Gamble"><a href="#Can-You-Serve-as-a-Deacon-if-You-Gamble" class="headerlink" title="Can You Serve as a Deacon if You Gamble?"></a>Can You Serve as a Deacon if You Gamble?</h1><p>Church leaders are constantly faced with difficult questions. One question that has been asked recently is whether someone who gambles can serve as a deacon.</p>
<p>First, it is important to understand the role of a deacon in the church. Deacons are appointed by the bishop and are responsible for ministering to the needs of the congregation. This includes both practical and spiritual needs. Deacons may also be assigned specific duties, such as leading worship or preaching.</p>
<p>Since gambling is a sin, it would seem that someone who gambles could not serve as a deacon. However, there are several things to consider. First, not everyone who gambles is guilty of sin. There may be occasions when gambling is not sinful, such as when it is used for entertainment purposes only. Second, even if gambling is sin, it does not necessarily mean that someone who gambles cannot serve as a deacon. It may be possible for that person to repent and overcome their sin.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to the bishop to decide whether someone who gambles can serve as a deacon. If there is any doubt about whether someone is fit for this role, the bishop should err on the side of caution and not appoint that person.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-the-Bible-Say-About-Being-a-Deacon-and-Gambling"><a href="#What-Does-the-Bible-Say-About-Being-a-Deacon-and-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Bible Say About Being a Deacon and Gambling?"></a>What Does the Bible Say About Being a Deacon and Gambling?</h1><p>In many Christian churches, there is both a diaconate and a deacon. The diaconate is the group of people who have been ordained to help in the work of the church. The deacons, on the other hand, are a separate group who assist the diaconate. Deacons often perform tasks such as caring for the sick, helping those in need, and distributing food.</p>
<p>What does the Bible say about being a deacon and gambling? There is no specific mention of gambling in the Bible. However, there are principles that can be applied to this question. One principle is that we should not gamble with what belongs to others. This would include money that we have been entrusted with or money that we owe to others. Proverbs tells us “The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous gives generously” (Proverbs 22:7).</p>
<p>Another principle is that we should not be wasteful with our money. This principle is found in both the Old Testament and New Testament. In 1 Timothy 5:8, Paul says “If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.” In Luke 12:15-21, Jesus says “And he said to them, Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.”</p>
<p>Based on these principles, it would seem that gambling would be inconsistent with being a deacon. Gambling often involves risking money that we do not have on outcomes that are uncertain. This can lead to greed and a desire for more wealth than we need. It can also lead to wasteful spending.</p>

Some people think that gambling is no big deal, while others believe that it’s a sin to gamble under any circumstances. So, what does the Bible say about gambling?</p>
<p>There are a few scriptures in the Bible that give us some insight into God’s views on gambling. The first verse that we’ll look at is from Deuteronomy: “He who gambles with God shall flee from him.” (Deuteronomy 23:17) This verse makes it clear that gambling is not something that God approves of.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy, we read: “Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions… those who practice these things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” (1 Timothy 5:22-23) This verse makes it clear that gambling is one of the things that will keep someone from entering into heaven.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for those in church leadership positions? It means that they should avoid gambling at all costs. Gambling can be addictive and can lead to all sorts of other sinfulness. Church leaders should be examples to their congregations and should set the example by living a holy life. Gambling is not part of that equation.</p>
