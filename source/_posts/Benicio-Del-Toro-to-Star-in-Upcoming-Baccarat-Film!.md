#  What is the Worth of a King in Baccarat?

The worth of a king in Baccarat is 4 points. When the point total of a player’s two cards is a king, they are said to have a “natural”, and this is an automatic winning hand. The value of other ranks is as follows:

Ace: 1 point
2: 2 points
3: 3 points
4: 4 points
5: 5 points
6: 6 points
7: 7 points 
8: 8 points 
9: 9 points 
10: 10 points
JACK: 11 point





When playing Baccarat, the aim is to get as close as possible to nine with two cards, without going over. In the event that both you and the banker have the same total (e.g. 5), the game is a draw and no one wins or loses money on that particular hand. In order to win, your card must be lower than the banker’s card – so if they have a six and you have an ace, you lose even though your ace is worth 1 point and their six is worth 6 points.





Baccarat can be played with anywhere from one to eight decks of cards (the number of decks used will affect the house edge), and each player is dealt two cards face down. There are three possible outcomes in Baccarat – player win, banker win or tie. The dealer position rotates around the table so everyone has a chance to be the banker. In order to place a bet, players must first place an “ante” bet which is basically just like a compulsory blind in poker – it goes into the pot and gives everyone at the table an equal chance, regardless of their hand strength. After all players have placed their antes, they then get to make two more optional bets – one for the player to win, and one for the banker to win. You can also bet on there being a tie (but remember, this has already been factored into the house edge).

While there's no guarantee that Del Toro will walk away with a fortune every time he plays baccarat, his success rate speaks for itself. So if you're looking for a chance to make some serious money, consider giving this exciting casino game a try.
