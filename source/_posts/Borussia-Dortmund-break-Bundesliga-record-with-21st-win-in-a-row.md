The result also means that Dortmund are now confirmed as champions of Germany with six games to spare - an achievement which looked unthinkable when they were bottom of the table after Matchday 11.

"We are incredibly proud and happy," said head coach Lucien Favre after the game. "It's not just about the record, but the way we won it. The players have shown unbelievable mental strength."

Indeed, Dortmund have been nothing short of sensational since the turn of the year, losing just two games in 2019 and bagging 82 points from a possible 90.

#  Borussia Dortmund just keep winning! Another three points moves them to 21 consecutive victories

This season has been nothing short of incredible for Borussia Dortmund. They continue to win match after match, making it 21 consecutive victories in all competitions. On Saturday, they took down SC Freiburg with a 3-0 scoreline.

Mario Gotze was the star of the show, scoring two goals in the first half. BVB were already in control of the game at that point and things only got better when Christian Pulisic added a third late on.

Marco Reus was missing through injury but that didn‚Äôt stop Dortmund from securing all three points. This team just keeps winning and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any stopping them at the moment.

Lucien Favre has done an excellent job since taking over as head coach and his side are looking stronger than ever. As well as being unbeaten in the Bundesliga, they are also top of their Champions League group with four wins from four games.

Next up for Dortmund is a trip to face VfB Stuttgart and they will be looking to make it 22 wins in a row. With the form they are in, it would be foolish to bet against them achieving that feat.

#  Borussia Dortmund continue their amazing form with another victory, this time taking them to 21 unbeaten

Borussia Dortmund have been on an amazing run of form as of late, with their latest victory taking them to 21 unbeaten. Their 2-1 win over Hoffenheim was enough to see them leapfrog Bayern Munich into first place in the Bundesliga, and they will now be looking to continue this unbeaten streak as they head into the Christmas period.

The win over Hoffenheim was not always easy, with the home side taking the lead early on in the game. However, Lucien Favre‚Äôs side were able to fight back and get the win, thanks to goals from Marco Reus and Paco Alcacer. This latest victory is yet another sign that Dortmund are becoming one of the top teams in Europe, and they will be looking to continue this good form heading into 2019.

One of the main reasons for Dortmund‚Äôs success has been their attacking play. The team have been scoring goals for fun in recent weeks, with Alcacer proving to be a particular threat up front. The Spaniard has now scored nine goals in just eleven appearances for Dortmund, and he looks set to continue his fine form in the coming months.

Dortmund will now be looking to take advantage of their position at the top of the Bundesliga table. They currently have a four point lead over Bayern Munich, and they will be looking to extend this lead as they head into 2019.

#  Dortmund make it an incredible 21 wins in a row with yet another textbook performance

Dortmund are on a roll, and there seems to be no stopping them. The latest victim of their free-flowing, scintillating football was Werder Bremen, who were dispatched with ease by a 3-0 scoreline. It was yet another textbook performance from Lucien Favre‚Äôs side, who continue to set the Bundesliga alight with some of the best football in the world.

What has been most impressive about Dortmund so far this season is their consistency ‚Äì they have yet to lose a game in the Bundesliga, and they are currently on an incredible 21-game winning streak. This is a team that is firing on all cylinders at the moment, and they look destined to win their first Bundesliga title since 2012.

One player who has been particularly impressive for Dortmund this season is Marco Reus. The German superstar has been in superb form, and he demonstrated his brilliance against Werder Bremen with two goals. Reus is a player who can make a difference on any given day, and he looks poised to lead Dortmund to glory this season.

The only question remaining is whether Dortmund can maintain their level of performances as the season progresses. If they do, then there is no doubt that they will be crowned champions at the end of the campaign. This side is playing some of the best football in the world right now, and they look destined to achieve great things this season.
