#  California Poised to Legalize Online Gambling

On February 25, 2019, the Associated Press reported that Assemblyman Adam Gray introduced a bill to legalize online gambling in California. The proposed bill would allow people within the state to gamble on casino games and sports through websites and apps. If the bill is passed, California would join New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware as states with legalized online gambling.

Gray believes that the proposed bill would be beneficial for the state’s economy. He estimates that it could generate between $200 million and $300 million in annual revenue. In addition, he argues that it would create jobs in the technology and gaming industries.

Governor Gavin Newsom has not yet taken a position on the proposed bill. However, his predecessor, Governor Jerry Brown, vetoed a similar proposal in 2018.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. They also contend that it is difficult to regulate.

In 2017, the American Gaming Association released a study which found that approximately 21 million Americans gambled online in 2016. The study also found that online gamblers wagered a total of $4.6 billion in 2016, up from $3.5 billion in 2015.

#  California Gambling Bill on the Verge of Becoming Law

The California gambling bill is on the verge of becoming law, as it has cleared the final legislative hurdle. The bill will legalize a number of new forms of gambling, including online poker and sports betting.

Governor Jerry Brown has already signaled his support for the measure, and is expected to sign it into law in the coming days. This will make California the largest state in the US to have legalized online poker and sports betting.

 supporters of the bill say that it will help to generate much-needed revenue for the state. They estimate that it could bring in up to $1 billion in annual revenue. opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and other social harms.

The passage of the bill comes after years of debate and discussion in California. The issue has been a polarizing one, with strong proponents and detractors on both sides.

Now that the bill has cleared the final legislative hurdle, it is likely to become law in short order. This will make California the latest state to legalize online poker and sports betting, following in the footsteps of Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.

#  California Moves Closer to Legalizing Online Poker

#

After a few years of setbacks, California is once again moving closer to legalizing online poker. This time, the state seems likely to succeed thanks to strong bipartisan support in the legislature.

#

Online poker has been illegal in California since 2006, when then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill into law that made it a felony to operate an online poker site in the state. But the landscape has changed significantly since then. In 2011, the U.S. Justice Department issued a ruling that overturned a federal ban on online gambling, opening the door for individual states to legalize it if they choose.

#

Several states have since legalized some form of online gambling, including Nevada and New Jersey. And while California has not yet taken that step, there is growing bipartisan support for doing so. Earlier this year, a bill that would legalize and regulate online poker was introduced in the state legislature and it has already passed two committees with broad bipartisan support.

#

The key question now is whether Governor Jerry Brown will sign the bill into law. Brown has not taken a position on the bill, but he has been generally supportive of gambling expansion in the past. In 2013, he signed a bill that legalized fantasy sports betting in California. And last year, he approved legislation to allow tribal casinos in California to offer online gaming services to their customers.

#

There is some opposition to online poker legalization in California, particularly from casino interests who are concerned about competition from online operators. But given the broad bipartisan support for the bill in the legislature, it is likely to pass if it makes it to the governor’s desk.

#  California Close to Legalizing Online Gambling

After years of debate and discussion, California is close to legalizing online gambling. The bill, which has already been passed by the state Senate, is now making its way through the Assembly.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will help to generate revenue for the state. They also say that it will create jobs and boost the economy. Opponents argue that it will lead to addiction and social ills.

If the bill is passed, it will be up to the individual counties to decide whether or not to allow gambling websites to operate within their borders. Some counties are likely to prohibit them, while others may welcome them with open arms.

There are already a number of offshore sites that operate in California and other states where online gambling is legal. These sites are expected to expand into California if the bill is passed.

The bill would legalize various types of gambling, including poker, blackjack, and slots. It would also allow casinos to offer their games online.

California is not the only state considering legalizing online gambling. New Jersey has already legalized it, and several other states are looking into the possibility.

#  California Set to Legalize Online Poker

Californians are one step closer to being able to play online poker. On Wednesday, July 11th, the state Senate voted in favor of a bill that would legalize and regulate the game. The bill now heads to the Assembly for final approval before it can be signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown.

Supporters of the bill say that it will help bring in much-needed revenue to the Golden State. It is estimated that legalizing and regulating online poker could generate as much as $330 million in annual revenue. Some of that money would be used to fund programs for treating problem gamblers, while some would also go towards California’s budget deficit.

Opponents of the bill, such as casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, argue that online poker is too risky and could lead to addiction problems for players. They also believe that it could be used by criminals to launder money.

If the bill is signed into law, California will become the fourth US state to legalize online poker. New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada already offer online poker games to their residents.
