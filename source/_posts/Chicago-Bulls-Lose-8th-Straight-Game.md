The Chicago Bulls lose their 8th straight game and continue to struggle this season. The Bulls were led by Zach LaVine who scored a team-high 21 points. Kris Dunn and Bobby Portis also scored in double figures with 13 and 12 points, respectively.

The Bulls looked like they might snap their losing streak early on as they jumped out to a 15-point lead in the first quarter. However, the Celtics went on a run in the second quarter and took the lead going into halftime.

Boston would go on to extend their lead in the second half and win the game 116-105. The Celtics were led by Kyrie Irving who scored 28 points on 11-of-19 shooting. Jaylen Brown added 23 points while Marcus Morris had 20 points off the bench.

#  Chicago Bulls Lose To Miami Heat 108-94: What Does It Mean For The Season?

The Chicago Bulls (24-33) lost to the Miami Heat (35-19) 108-94 on Tuesday night. This was their fourth loss in a row and it snapped their two-game winning streak. What does this loss mean for the rest of their season?

For one, the Bulls are now 3.5 games behind the Miami Heat for the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. They also have a two-game deficit to make up in order to clinch a playoff spot. If they want to make it to the playoffs, they will need to play much better than they have been lately.

In addition, this loss marks another chapter in the Bulls' struggles against teams with a winning record. They are now 7-16 against teams with a better record than them. Their only wins against teams with a winning record have come against the Charlotte Hornets, Milwaukee Bucks, and Washington Wizards.

Finally, Jimmy Butler had an awful game against the Heat. He shot just 4-of-17 from the field and finished with 10 points. This was his lowest scoring output since December 14th against the Orlando Magic. Butler will need to play better if the Bulls want to make a playoff run.

#  Derrick Rose Comments On Chicago Bulls' Recent Struggles, Defends Team

Derrick Rose has been a spokesman for the Chicago Bulls since he entered the league in 2008. He has always been one to take the blame and deflect praise, no matter what the circumstance. As the Bulls have struggled mightily as of late, with a record of 4-20 in their last 24 games, Rose has been compelled to speak out.

"It's just tough right now," Rose said. "We're going through a lot as a team. I think everybody can see that. We're just not playing our best basketball. But we've got each other's backs (and) we're going to continue to fight."

It would be easy for Rose to wash his hands of this current situation and focus on his impending free agency come this summer. However, he continues to be a leader for this Bulls squad, despite their record indicating otherwise.

"I love my guys," Rose continued. "I love my team no matter what the record says or how we're playing. Like I said before, we're going to stick together and continue to fight."

This Bulls team is full of young players with potential who are still learning how to win at the NBA level; players like Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen and Kris Dunn. With veterans like Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday also on board, there is plenty of leadership within this team - it's just a matter of putting it all together on the court.

"We've got a lot of young guys," Lopez said following Wednesday night's loss to San Antonio Spurs. "We've just got to keep grinding out there, keep competing and hopefully things will turn around."
