#  How to Play Multiplication Bingo in Azerbaijan

In Azerbaijan, multiplication bingo is a popular game for students of all ages. The goal of the game is to fill in all of the squares on one's Bingo card with multiplications that match the ones called out by the game caller.

To begin, each player is given a Bingo card and some chips. One player is chosen to be the caller, and they stand at the front of the room with a container of small pieces of paper that have different multiplications written on them. The caller calls out a number, and the players try to find it on their Bingo cards and cover it with a chip.

If a player has more than one chip on a square, they can choose which one to keep. The first player to cover all of their squares on their card wins the game.

Multiplication bingo can be played with any set of numbers, but it is most commonly played using multiples of 10. Here are a few examples:

The caller calls out: 4

Player covers square: 4 Ã— 10 = 40
Player covers square: 4 Ã— 5 = 20
Player covers square: 4 Ã— 2 = 8


The caller calls out: 9
Player covers square: 9 Ã— 10 = 90
Player covers square: 9 Ã— 5 = 45

#  A Fun Way to Learn Multiplication Tables in Azerbaijan

In Azerbaijan, children learn multiplication tables in a fun and unique way. They use an abacus to help them learn the multiplication tables. The abacus is a tool that has been used for centuries to help people with mathematical calculations.
