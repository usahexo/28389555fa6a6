#  Jimmy Kimmel Roulette: What to Do If You Play Amo

Jimmy Kimmel is a late night talk show host who has been stirring up controversy in recent months. He created a game called “Jimmy Kimmel Roulette” which is played by calling someone and asking them if they want to play. If they say yes, the person then has to do something embarrassing or risky.

If you find yourself on the receiving end of a Jimmy Kimmel Roulette call, there are a few things you can do to protect yourself. First, it’s important to understand that you don’t have to answer the call if you don’t want to. You can simply hang up or ignore the call.

If you decide to answer the call, try to figure out why the person is calling. Is it a friend playing a prank, or someone who wants to embarrass you? If it’s someone you know, be polite and see if you can talk them out of doing anything risky. If it’s someone you don’t know, try to stall for time and see if you can find out more information about them before agreeing to do anything.

If the caller insists on doing something risky, try to negotiate a safer alternative. For example, if they want you to jump into a swimming pool full of snakes, maybe agree to jump into a pool of rubber snakes instead. Or if they want you to streak through your neighborhood, consider wearing something that will cover your private parts.

No matter what happens, remember to stay calm and avoid doing anything that could get you in trouble with the law. And if things get too dangerous or uncomfortable, feel free to end the call and walk away.

#   Jimmy Kimmel's Roulette Edition: What to do if you Play Amo

On Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel aired a "Best of 2018" episode which featured some of the most popular bits from the year. One of these bits was his now infamous "Roulette Edition" of "What to do if you Play Amo."

The premise is simple: Kimmel takes four celebrities and brands them with one of four colors -- green, red, yellow, or blue. The celebrities then have to complete a series of challenges while their color is displayed on their forehead. If they fail, they're out and the last celebrity remaining is the winner.

In the latest edition, Kimmel pitted Green Jimmy against Red John, Yellow Sarah against Blue Kate, and so on. The competition was intense but in the end Green Jimmy emerged victorious.

So what can you learn from Kimmel's "Roulette Edition"? Here are three tips:

1. Stay calm and focus on the task at hand.

This is easier said than done, but it's important to remember that panicking will only make things worse. In many cases, the pressure of being in front of a large audience can be overwhelming. But if you stay calm and focused, you'll be more likely to succeed.

2. Make sure you're familiar with the task at hand.

This goes hand in hand with staying calm. If you know what you're doing, you'll be less likely to panic or make mistakes. Familiarize yourself with all aspects of the challenge before starting it to give yourself the best chance of success.

3. Have fun and don't take things too seriously.

This is especially important if things don't go your way. Remember that it's just a game and there are no real stakes involved. This will help you stay relaxed and focused when faced with challenging tasks.
