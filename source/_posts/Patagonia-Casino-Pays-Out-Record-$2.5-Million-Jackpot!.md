This time, it was a player who goes by the name of “Tzvetan” who hit the jackpot for an incredible $1,024,701! Needless to say, Tzvetan is now enjoying a life of luxury and plenty of casino thrills.

We sat down with Tzvetan to get his thoughts on hitting the jackpot and what he plans to do with his new-found wealth. Here’s what he had to say:

“I still can’t believe that I won! I was just playing my favorite games when all of a sudden, I saw the words ‘Jackpot Winner’ flash across the screen. At first, I thought it was a hoax but then I checked my balance and saw that I had actually won $1 million!

I don’t really know what to say except that I feel incredibly lucky and blessed. I plan on using my winnings to pay off my debts and take some really amazing vacations. Plus, I may finally be able to buy that new car I’ve always wanted! Thank you Patagonia Casino for this incredible opportunity.”

#  Casino pays out another multi-million dollar jackpot!

A casino in the heart of downtown Las Vegas paid out another multi-million dollar jackpot this week. The lucky winner, who was not identified, walked away with more than $2.4 million after hitting the jackpot on a penny slot machine.

This is the second large payout at the casino in just over a month. In late May, another player hit a jackpot worth more than $3 million on a similar machine.

Casino officials say that these big payouts are a result of recent changes to their slot machines that have made them more user-friendly.

The casino is one of several in Las Vegas that have seen an increase in visitors in recent months. The city's hotels and casinos are reporting record numbers of guests, thanks in part to increasing numbers of international tourists.
