#  Stardust Casino's Mambo Unlimited Blackjack Game Officially Replaced

After a long wait, Stardust Casino's Mambo Unlimited Blackjack game has finally been replaced. The new game, entitled 'Six Deck Blackjack', offers a much more realistic and fluid experience for players.

The old game was plagued with glitches and errors, which made it difficult for players to enjoy the experience. In contrast, the new game runs smoothly and without any major issues.

In addition, the new game offers several different settings that players can adjust to create the perfect gaming experience for them. For instance, players can choose to play with anywhere from 1 to 6 decks of cards, depending on their preferences.

Additionally, the dealer's actions can be customized to match those of a live dealer or automated dealer. This ensures that players will have a gaming experience that is as close to reality as possible.

#  Online Casino Stardust Switches to New Blackjack Game

The popular online casino Stardust has announced that they are switching to a new blackjack game. The new game, which is called Vegas Strip Blackjack, will have some changes that players should be aware of before they start playing.

The first thing that players will notice is that the rules are slightly different. In the old game, players could hit on any number of cards and could also double down after splitting. In the new game, players can only hit on a hard total of 9 or less and can only double down on a hard total of 10 or 11.

Another change is that the dealer must stand on all 17s. In the old game, the dealer could hit on soft 17s. This change makes it a bit harder for the player to win because the dealer is more likely to make a good hand.

Players should also be aware that there is a bonus payout for blackjacks. In the old game, blackjacks paid out at 3-to-2 odds. In the new game, they pay out at 2-to-1 odds. This means that players will lose money more slowly in the new game, but they wonâ€™t earn as much when they do get a blackjack.

Overall, these changes make the new Vegas Strip Blackjack game less favourable for the player. However, it is still possible to win money by playing smartly and using proper strategy.

#  Mambo Unlimited Blackjack Game Discontinued at Stardust Casino

The Mambo Unlimited blackjack game has been discontinued at the Stardust Casino in Las Vegas. This was confirmed by a spokesperson from the casino, who said that the game is no longer available for play.

This news will come as a disappointment to many blackjack fans, as the Mambo Unlimited game was considered to be one of the most exciting versions of the game currently available. The main draw of the game was its fast-paced action, which made it perfect for players who wanted a more thrilling experience than what is typically available at traditional blackjack tables.

The spokesperson did not provide a reason for why the game was discontinued, but it is possible that the casino decided to make this change in order to focus on other games. While there has been no confirmation of this, it is possible that the casino may be looking to launch a new blackjack game in order to appeal to players who are looking for something new and exciting.
