#  A New Twist on an Old classic: Blackjack Shakespeare

Fans of blackjack may be surprised to learn that the game has a deep and complex history, with roots that go back centuries. What may be even more surprising is that this storied game was adapted for the stage by one of the world’s most renowned playwrights – William Shakespeare.

Blackjack first appeared in print in a book called “The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe”, which was published in 1719. The game enjoyed a surge in popularity in the early 1800s, and it was during this time that it was adapted for the stage by Shakespeare.

Shakespeare’s version of blackjack is called “21” and is similar to the game we know today. However, there are some key differences. For example, players can only bet on one number at a time, and there is no splitting or doubling down.

Despite its name, 21 was not actually invented by Shakespeare. In fact, the game is thought to have originated in France sometime in the 1700s. However, it was Shakespeare who brought it to the attention of English audiences, and his version quickly became popular.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in 21 – thanks in part to its inclusion in several popular films and television shows. As a result, many people are now looking to learn how to play this intriguing game.

If you want to try your hand at 21 (or blackjack), there are several ways you can go about it. You can find online tutorials that will teach you the basics of the game; or, if you prefer, you can attend a live casino event where you can play against other members of the audience.

No matter how you choose to learn it, blackjack is a great game that offers plenty of excitement and intrigue. So what are you waiting for? Give it a try today!

#  So Many New Versions of an Old Favorite- Which is the Best? Blackjack Shakespeare!!

As casino games go, blackjack is one of the oldest and most popular. But as with all things old, over the years there have been many new versions and variations of this classic. So which one should you choose to play?

One version that has become popular in recent years is Blackjack Shakespeare. This game is played with a deck of 52 cards, and the goal is still to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The difference is that players are dealt two cards at a time, and can choose to hit or stand according to the rules of blackjack.

Another variation is Spanish 21. This game uses a deck of 48 cards, with all 10s removed. This makes it harder for players to achieve 21, but also means that the house edge is lower. In Spanish 21, players can double down on any two cards, and can also split pairs up to four times.

If you’re looking for something a little different, there’s always Double Exposure Blackjack. In this game, both dealer’s cards are face up, so players can see what they’re up against right away. This can make for some very exciting gameplay, as players need to make decisions quickly!

So which version of blackjack should you play? It really depends on your personal preferences and style of play. If you want a fast-paced game with plenty of excitement, Double Exposure Blackjack might be the perfect choice for you. If you prefer a more traditional game with fewer twists and turns, then Spanish 21 might be a better option. And if you want to try something new but still want the classic blackjack experience, Blackjack Shakespeare is definitely worth checking out!
