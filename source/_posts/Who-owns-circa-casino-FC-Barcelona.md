#  Who owns circa casino FC Barcelona?

While Qatar Sports Investments have been the majority shareholder of FC Barcelona since 2010, rumours abound as to who exactly owns the club. In 2013, 6% of the shares in the club were sold to an unknown investment group, later revealed to be from Saudi Arabia. When questioned on the matter, Barcelona President Josep Maria Bartomeu stated that he could not reveal the identity of the shareholders due to a confidentiality agreement. The lack of transparency has led some to speculate that the true ownership lies with the Saudi Royal Family or even the Qatari government themselves.

This mystery is not only confined to Barcelona - many football clubs around Europe are owned by anonymous shell companies or opaque holding groups. In Britain, for example, Manchester City is owned by a company registered in Abu Dhabi, while Arsenal is held by a company in Monaco. Chelsea is owned by a Russian billionaire, and Liverpool is now majority-owned by an American investment firm. While it is not illegal for these investors to keep their identities hidden, it does beg the question as to why they feel the need to do so.

Given recent events in Qatar - where the government has been accused of funding terrorism and imprisoning journalists - it would not be surprising if Barca's Qatari owners are looking to keep a low profile. However, given how popular FC Barcelona is worldwide, it seems unlikely that they will be able to stay under the radar for much longer.

#  How long has the club been owned by the current owners?

#  What is the club's net worth?

If you're wondering what the club's net worth is, you've come to the right place. We'll break it all down for you and give you a snapshot of what the club is worth financially.

To start, the club's total assets are valued at $432 million. This breaks down into $402 million in fixed assets and $30 million in current assets. The bulk of the fixed assets come from the team's stadium, which is valued at $400 million.

The liabilities of the club are worth a total of $258 million. This includes $215 million in long-term liabilities and $43 million in short-term liabilities. The largest portion of the long-term liabilities comes from bank loans, which account for $185 million.

When you subtract the liabilities from the assets, this leaves the club with a net worth of $174 million. This is up from last year's net worth of $137 million. So overall, things are looking good for the club financially.

Of course, there are always things that could be improved upon. But overall, we think that the club is in a strong position moving forward. Thanks for reading!

#  What are the potential implications of a change in ownership?

A change in ownership could result in a number of potential implications, some of which may include:

1. A change in the company's strategic direction, as the new owners may have different plans for the business.

2. Less funds available for investment, as the new owners may be more interested in repatriating profits than reinvesting back into the company.

3. A decrease in employee morale, as employees may feel that they are no longer valued or part of a team if new owners come in and make sweeping changes.

4. Changes to company policies and procedures, which the new owners may feel are necessary to improve performance or competitiveness.

5. Difficulty retaining talented workers, as employees may be lured away by other companies who are perceived to have a more stable future with new ownership.

#  What do the owners do outside of owning a football club?

Many football fans are unaware of what their team's owners do outside of owning a football club. For example, Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan is also the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and owns the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which is one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds.

Meanwhile, Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke is the founder of Kroenke Sports and Entertainment, which owns numerous sports teams in the United States including the Los Angeles Rams and Denver Nuggets. John W. Henry, who owns Liverpool and Fenway Sports Group, also owns The Boston Globe and The New England Sports Network.

These examples just scratch the surface of what these owners do outside of their football clubs. Some own vast businesses empires while others have political aspirations. Regardless, it's fascinating to see what else these individuals are involved in and how they're able to balance their commitments to both football and other ventures.
